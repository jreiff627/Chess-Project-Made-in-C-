How to define enemy Path?
<enemy path>
look at the kings dest postion that is plans on moving towards, then scan in a particular direction. i.e. the row, colum, diagonal. or more.
placing the origin or tail of the vector from the dest postion, and then the tip of the vector at those spots checked before being valid.

there needs to be a heirechy of scanning. i.e,
check for :
pawns 
knights
bishop





while(kingXdest != enemy path){
    validity = 1;
    i++;
} else{
validity =0
}
